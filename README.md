# 23cm
23cm NBFM transceiver

These files are the sources for my design of the 23cm NBFM transceiver. 
For more information or a complete kit please visit www.pe1jpd.nl.
The development environment is AVR Studio 4 from Atmel.
The processor is an ATMEGA328 with default, factory fuse settings.
The file spectrum.c is linked but not included in the menu because 1MHz default clock frequency is too slow to be useful.
